This page is not required to read at all for the competition (it's a lot). However, if you wish to read more about
the world and characters created, it will all be here for your enjoyment.

Everything will be listed as bullet points to avoid "bricks" of text, but the content is still good!

The Story Lore
==============

- A long-winded war has been taking place between two nations -- Uroda in the west, and Turpis in the east
- In the past, Turpis and Uroda used to be one nation called Tatem. Due to a civil war 200 years ago,
  they split up into the two nations
- Since the split of the two nations, Uroda has been a prosperous land, filled with beautiful lands and wealth
- Turpis, however, slowly fell into ruin due to reckless attempts at advancing technology at an unruly pace.
  The land became useless for growing crops, and the nation fell into severe poverty
- Turpis, despite being in poverty, is pouring all their last resources into the war. This is a huge
  gamble, as losing the war would lead to the collapse of the nation
- This new war broke out because Turpis' leader desires to restore the original nation of Tatem and to rule over
  it, saving Turpis and having access to the wealth Uroda currently has
- For 2 years, the nations have fought, and either nation could still win. With the war being so close, each
  nation is desperate to do anything to win

Fultra the Pompous
------------------

- Full name: Fultra Von Drefou

Background
..........

- Fultra grew up in a very wealthy family, having everything he ever could've wanted
- He lived in a mansion, had servants to tend to his needs, and he didn't need to lift a finger
- Due to his parents' obsession with money, Fultra faced extreme child negation
- He would constantly do things to gain his parents' approval/attention, only to be brushed off
- Fultra eventually ran away from home as a young teen, taking a lot of money from the safe and some of his
  family's possessions -- most importantly his grandfather's bow and quiver
- Fultra tried to live a quiet life but simply couldn't since he was used to living so lavishly
- He eventually bought himself a decent house and hired many people to help train him in combat
- He decided to leave the lavish life he knew and to become a mercenary, wanting to become famous so his parents
  would finally acknowledge him
- This path was also what his grandfather did, using electric magic to enhance his bow and arrows
- While Fultra tried to change his life style, living exuberantly was all he knew
- So while he became a famous mercenary with a keen eye, he's also known for not wearing traditional armor/mercenary
  clothing. Instead, he wears light clothing such as his signature tank top and goggles
- His reasoning is that since he can strike from afar, he'll defeat his opponents before they can even hurt him
- His style has granted him the title "Fultra the Pompous"

- To compensate for being vertically challenged, she would work out and help out in the small village where she
  grew up. This includes partaking in hunting, fishing, lumber work, etc
- However, due to her size, she could barely pick up any of the tools used since they were as large as she was
- People then started to assume she was stupid for constantly trying to help, and she gained the local nickname
  of "Lil Ninny"
- However, the constant bullying and belittling she faced did not deter her
- She decided to train and to become known for her strength rather than her size
- She left her village as an early teen to work under other mercenaries

  feared by most for her sheer power

- Calmus' parents died when he was 6 due to war in another nation
- After the war, he had to care of his sister who was 1 year old at the time and live with his grandmother
- Wrecked with sorrow, he did not know how to handle his emotions properly, and would take them out on
  others, wishing he could've saved his parents despite his young age
- His grandmother helped him get through this and helped him use these emotions and harness them in fire magic
- As he grew, his flame grew hotter, and he was able to control them to take shape into certain objects
- He eventually decided to become a mercenary to prevent wars from getting to the point that he witnessed
  at a young age
- Before he left his grandmother and little sister, his grandmother gave him his father's prized scimitar
- The scimitar has become part of Calmus' identity, forcing all to fear the crescent-shaped sword and his
  shield of flames

  "Calmus the Ignited"

Irwin the Scarred

- Eventually, a man named Darrell, who was the leader of a gang of bandits, found Irwin and took him in
- He was fed, clothed, and learned how cruel the world was
- The group of bandits trained him, and he eventually became a prominent member at the age of 14
- Eventually, the bandits were raiding a town in a distant nation for money
- A solider named Lac the Stout lived in this town and tried to defend his home by
  himself (he was the only soldier there, so he fought to allow everyone a chance to escape, including his daughter)
- Irwin, who had only fought and never killed anyone, was terrified to see such a foe
- However, Lac got the better of Darrell and defeated him, the only man Irwin could call a father
