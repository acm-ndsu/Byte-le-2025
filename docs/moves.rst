Moves are how characters fight and interact with each other. A good moveset can make or break a character and team
composition, so pay attention to how they function!

Types of Moves
--------------

There are four (4) types of Moves that a character's Moveset can contain:

================= ========================================================================================
Move Type         Description
================= ========================================================================================
:gold:`Attack`    Deals damage to decrease the target(s)'s health.
:green:`Heal`     Heals the target(s) a set amount to offset damage taken previously.
:red:`Buff`       Increases one of the target(s)'s stats. Good for getting an edge in combat!
:blue:`Debuff`    Decreases one of the target(s)'s stats. Good for putting the opponent at a disadvantage!
================= ========================================================================================


Effects
-------

Some Moves are useful for a character because they have secondary Effects. If a Move has a secondary Effect, the
character is essentially performing two (2) Moves in one turn! Effects fall under the same four (4) categories:

- :gold:`Attack`
- :green:`Heal`
- :red:`Buff`
- :blue:`Debuff`

An Effect can sometimes have a drawback for the user, so be mindful when using a Move with a secondary Effect!


Special Points
--------------

Not all Moves can be used immediately. A character needs to build up the strength to use some moves by increasing
their :cyan:`Special Points`. :cyan:`Special Points` can be gained and lost during a match depending on the Move that's
used. A character can gain a maximum of five (5) :cyan:`Special Points`. How :cyan:`Special Points` are gained and
lost is explained below in the next section.


Movesets
--------

To contain a character's Moves, they have an attribute called a Moveset. A Moveset will contain 3 Moves that are broken
into three (3) categories:

========================= ==============================================================================================
Moveset Identifier        Description
========================= ==============================================================================================
Normal Move               A character's default Move. By using a Normal Move, a character will gain +1
                          :cyan:`Special Point`.
Special 1                 A Move with some more "oomph" to it. This will *reduce* a character's :cyan:`Special Points`
                          by the cost of the Move.
Special 2                 A Move that tends to be a character's strongest. This will also *reduce* a character's
                          :cyan:`Special Points` by the cost of the Move. *Special 2 is more expensive than Special 1.*
========================= ==============================================================================================

Understanding how a character's Moveset will affect not just the user but all characters on the map will help when
forming a team.

Every character's individual Moveset will be explained in depth in :doc:`characters`.
