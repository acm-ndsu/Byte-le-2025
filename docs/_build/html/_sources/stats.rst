Stats
=====

Every character has a unique set of stats, including attack, defense, and speed.

Attack
------

Attack is the amount of base damage a character can deal when using an Attack move. Essentially it is the strength of
the character, reflected by an integer between 0 and 100.

i.e. If the stat is 50, the character will attempt to deal 50 points of damage to the target.

Defense
-------

Defense is a percent of the amount of damage a character can prevent from taking from an Attack, represented by a number
between 0 - 100.

i.e. If the stat is 50, and the incoming damage is 50, the character will prevent 50% of the damage and only take 25
points of damage.

Speed
-----

Speed is the stat that determines the turn order of your team and who gets to act first each turn.
