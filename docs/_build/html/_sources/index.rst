For many years this battle has been fought, between the waring nations of :purple:`Turpis` and :gold:`Uroda`.
For many years each nation has been waiting for the decisive battle that could bring an end to the war. Neither nation
expected such a battle to be fought by mercenaries, but these are desperate times indeed. That is where you come in,
captain. You much organize and lead your group of mercenaries to battle and deliver us the end of the war!

Before you do so, however, it is best that you understand the art of war. Please, review and learn from this training
scroll (documentation) and refer to it anytime you find yourself lost. If this scroll does not appear to answer a
question of yours, you may consult a commander (developer) over at any time.
