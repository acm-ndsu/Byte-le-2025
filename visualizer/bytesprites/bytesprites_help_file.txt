Bytesprites are the logic that manipulates the spritesheets to make sprites dynamically
responsive to events in the game. These files will consist of Python code that call up
a row of animation as a result.

Spritesheets are read into a bytesprite as a list[list[pyg.Surface]]
when you return the row of animation you want to select, you can return spritesheets[# of row]
ex: spritesheets[0] for first row

bytesprites also extend BytespriteFactory, giving:
- Update method: returns list[pyg.Surface], row of animation to use for this turn
- Create method: returns a ByteSprite, which is the actual ByteSprite object displayed with
an associated spritesheet and all
