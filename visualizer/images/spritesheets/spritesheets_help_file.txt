This file is for sprite sheet .png files, which are organized as:
- columns: each frame in the animation
- rows: each state for the bytesprite to have

Images in this folder are used by the bytesprites in the bytesprites folder.

NOTE: For any spritesheets that have some form of transparency, make sure to set the colorkey of the
ByteSprite to the color chosen to be transparent. the default used in the past is pygame.Color(255, 0, 255).
