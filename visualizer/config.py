class Config:
    """
    Configuration class for the game visualizer. By encapsulating the visualizer settings in a class, the readonly
    nature of the following settings are enforced to a greater degree.

    **Number Of Frames Per Turn**
        Number of frames per turn is an int representing the number of animation frames on
        each turn. See spritesheets for an example of what is needed for 4 frames per turn.
        Set this to 1 if you do not want any animations.

    -----

    **Tile Size**
        Tile size is an int that represents the size of each sprite (it's a square, so this
        applies to both width and height).

    -----

    **Scale**
        Scale is an int that represents the ratio between the tile size and the number of
        pixels that it will take on the visualizer itself.

    -----

    **Screen Size**
        Screen size is a Vector that represents the dimensions of the visualizer.

    -----

    **Frame Rate**
        Frame rate is an int that represents the number of frames per second.

    -----

    **Background Color**
        Background Color is a tuple of 3 ints representing the red, green, and blue values
        of the background.

    -----

    **Gameboard Margin Left**
        Gameboard Margin Left is an int representing the margin from the left side
        of the screen that the gameboard will adhere to.

    -----

    **Gameboard Margin Top**
        Gameboard Margin Top is an int representing the margin from the top side of
        the screen that the gameboard will adhere to.

    -----

    **Visualize Held Items**
        Visualize Held Items is a boolean that represents if held items should be
        rendered and has supporting ByteSprites.
